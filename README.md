# UniW-rzburg-Simulations
This repository combines several simulations and code I wrote during my research internship under Sebastian Klembt and Johannes Düreth at the University of Würzburg. I investigated strong light-matter interaction in organic and inorganic microresonators, using and expanding on a provided transfer matrix formalism code base.
