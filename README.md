# UniW-rzburg-Simulations
This repository combines several simulations and code I wrote during my research internship under Sebastian Klembt and Johannes Düreth at the University of Würzburg. I investigated strong light-matter interaction in organic and inorganic microresonators, using and expanding on a provided transfer matrix formalism code base.

Much of the code found in this folder is based on previously developed classes written by my supervisor Johannes Düreth. This code is private and cannot be shared.
